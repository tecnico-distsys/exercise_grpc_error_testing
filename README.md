# gRPC testing

This is the base project for the gRPC testing application, composed of three modules:

- [contract](contract/) - protocol buffers definition
- [server](server/) - implementation of service
- [client](client/) - invocation of service

See the README for each module.  
Start at contract, then go to server, and finally go to the client.
